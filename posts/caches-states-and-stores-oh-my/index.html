    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In a recent discussion with coworkers we kept having to clarify the difference
between a cache, a state, and a store. The confusion was generally caused as a
result of vaguely discussing Vuex and the capacity of Vue 3&rsquo;s composition API
to substitute it for a store-based state management system that could also
serve to deliver cache benefits. Who could possibly get lost in that? :)</p>
<h1 id="cache">Cache</h1>
<p>A cache maintains data for the purpose of reducing performance overhead in
accessing the data. For example, the browser, unless instructed otherwise, will
often cache certain GET requests, like images and CSS, to limit the time it
takes to reload a page.</p>
<p>Caches are the most difficult paradigm here because of: cache invalidation.</p>
<p>Cache invalidation is how you determine if this data needs to be refetched or
recomputed. Browsers and servers rely on a set of protocols starting with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">HTTP</a>
that they follow to determine if the cache needs to be refreshed (if a file must
be reloaded) or not. But, as anyone in software dev who has disabled caching in
their browser probably knows, it doesn&rsquo;t always get it right.</p>
<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html">Because it&rsquo;s hard</a>. It&rsquo;s a
good exercise to try to implement this, or, if you&rsquo;re like most developers, to
suddenly realize that you&rsquo;re accidentally trying to implement it and come up
with an easier solution.</p>
<h1 id="state">State</h1>
<p>State is a more obvious concept, but it is managed in so many ways that it can
often get mixed up with others. State is just what the data, UI and so on of
an application look like at a given snapshot in time. For example the state of
an application that displays a to-do list may be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">{
	<span style="color:#a6e22e">loading</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">false</span>
	, <span style="color:#a6e22e">error</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">null</span>
	, <span style="color:#a6e22e">todos</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Buy groceries&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Invite friends for dinner&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Clean&#34;</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>States are functions of their data. In the above example,  the state is a
function of the three variables. A UI would interpret the &ldquo;not loading&rdquo; state,
as modeled by loading==false, by trying to render the error message or the list
of to-dos, depending on which one was valid data.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="wry-wsac.github.io/posts/tracking-loading-state/">lengthy article on several state management techniques</a>
and caveats, wherein I no doubt contributed to the confusion. State management
is complicated in all but the most trivial of applications because the number
of emergent states does not increase linearly with the increase of variables
supplied. This makes reasoning about states very challenging in larger
applications and gave rise to the model-view-update architecture of Elm and the
Flux framework, two primary antecedents to popular frameworks like Redux (and
unpopular ones like Vuex) to manage state in a store.</p>
<h1 id="store">Store</h1>
<p>A store is a central location for data. You have several views in your JS SPA
that need to access particular lookup data, or want to push data to each other
(for example in a wizard or other multi-step form). A store gives your views
a central place to access the data. Architecturally a store is perhaps most
easily analogized to a REST framework (if organized by resources, at least - a
store can be a free-for-all too). This is why the conversation can be confusing:
a store can manage state and act as a cache.</p>
<p>If we stuff our above to-do state into a store, we are now managing the state
with a store. If we want, we can implement basic caching by allowing the edit
button on the to-do list view push the id and text of the given to-do into a
to-do-form-store that then bypasses the need to refetch the data, making for a
smoother, lower-latency user experience.</p>
<p>A Vue template of components using a store architecture:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-vue" data-lang="vue">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">template</span>&gt;
	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">error-message</span> /&gt;
	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">loading-progress-bar</span> /&gt;
	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">todo-list</span> /&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">template</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Without it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-vue" data-lang="vue">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">template</span>&gt;
	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">error-message</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">v</span><span style="color:#f92672">-if</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">=</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">error</span> <span style="color:#f92672">:</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">message</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">error</span> <span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">@</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">refresh</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">loadTodos</span> /&gt;
	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">loading-progress-bar</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">v</span><span style="color:#f92672">-if</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">=</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">loading</span> /&gt;
	&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">todo-list</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">v</span><span style="color:#f92672">-if</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">=!</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">loading</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">todos</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">todos</span> /&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">template</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>The primary difference is a store encourages components to decide what data they
need to request, independent of the nested hierarchy of the view, and managing
state at the page level requires passing data to the components, but in
exchange, the big-picture-view from the developer&rsquo;s seat lay before you in a
singular file.</p>
<p>Some people find the latter&rsquo;s explicitness easiest to work with.
Some people find the former&rsquo;s atomicity easiest to work with.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for the store. And hate caching. And state management is just something
we gotta do, and I prefer to delegate certain aspects of that to a store. This
is a bit of an important distinction: the app described in the last example
would still probably have internal, private state. Sorting for example, unless
it was desirable to persist sorting and filtering, would likely remain a set of
internal variables on <code>&lt;todo-list /&gt;</code> rather than being pushed out to a store.
The decision depends on the need for other views to access and use the data.</p>
